1. ARCHAEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT  
PROBABLE – Strong, multi-line evidence for anthropic earthworks; minor uncertainties remain (canopy cover, moderate NDVI signal).

2. WATER ANOMALY EVALUATION  
9 / 10 – Distance of 159.5 km from any known perennial water source is unprecedented and poses a major explanatory challenge.

3. EVIDENCE QUALITY  
8 / 10 – Seven converging sources, fused score 0.98, positive CNN detection, coherent spatial clustering, and suitable topography all indicate robust evidence despite moderate NDVI variance and lack of bare-soil signature.

4. KEY OBSERVATIONS  
• Geometric patterns: Satellite imagery reveals rectilinear clearings and angular vegetation breaks consistent with ditched enclosures.  
• Vegetation anomalies: NDVI variance (0.021) higher than background, suggesting subsurface features influencing canopy vigour.  
• Spatial clustering: Site forms part of a larger patterned complex, reducing likelihood of natural origin.  
• Topographic setting: Positioned on a low, level interfluve that would have been buildable and defensible.  
• Contradictory point: BSI = 0.000 implies earthworks are fully vegetated, limiting surface confirmation.

5. WATER MANAGEMENT HYPOTHESIS (required for PROBABLE classification)  
Most parsimonious explanations, given present evidence:  
a) Paleo-hydrological shift – The occupied period may pre-date a river course migration or Holocene drying, placing the settlement closer to water at the time of use.  
b) Advanced water storage – Large, possibly lined reservoirs or cisterns supplied by seasonal rains; geomorphic depressions may be masked by canopy.  
c) Seasonal/ritual use – Occupation limited to rainy season when surface water was abundant; permanent residency not required.  
Current data do not allow discrimination among these options.

6. RESEARCH PRIORITY  
EXTREME – Verification would fundamentally alter models of Amazonian settlement ecology and water-dependence.

1. ARCHAEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT  
PROBABLE – Strong, multi-line evidence for anthropogenic earthworks, but canopy obstruction and the unprecedented water distance leave minor residual uncertainty.

2. WATER ANOMALY EVALUATION  
9 / 10 – The 156.8 km separation from perennial surface water is an extreme outlier that demands a credible explanation; it seriously challenges, though does not invalidate, the interpretation.

3. EVIDENCE QUALITY  
8 / 10 – Seven independent data streams converge (fused score 0.98). CNN earthwork detection, positive spatial clustering, and favourable micro-topography constitute robust indicators, tempered slightly by only moderate NDVI contrast and lack of ground verification.

4. KEY OBSERVATIONS  
• Geometric patterns: Rectilinear and circular signatures with crisp angularity detected by CNN; shapes fall within known pre-Columbian ditch dimensions (40–60 m).  
• Vegetation anomalies: NDVI variance (0.022) forms consistent outlines that match geometric signatures, suggesting buried ditches or embankments inhibiting deep-root growth.  
• Bare-soil signal: BSI ≈ 0 indicates low recent disturbance, compatible with re-vegetated earthworks rather than modern clearing.  
• Spatial clustering: Site lies inside a larger complex of similarly patterned anomalies spaced 2–4 km apart, a typical settlement-cluster geometry.  
• Topography: Slightly elevated interfluvial ridge (<15 m relief) offers drainage control and defensibility—favourable for occupation.  
• Indigenous territory status supports potential for cultural continuity, though no direct ethnographic link is provided.  
• No contradictory signals (e.g., modern agricultural rectilinear scars) are evident.

5. WATER MANAGEMENT HYPOTHESIS (required for PROBABLE rating)  
Most plausible explanations, given current evidence:  
a) Advanced storage systems – large, seasonally filled reservoirs/pans capturing wet-season rainfall; compatible with shallow depressions noted in DEM derivatives.  
b) Seasonal/episodic occupation – site used primarily during wet season when temporary streams form; would reduce year-round water demand.  
c) Environmental change – palaeohydrological shift could have left the site far from water today but nearer to palaeochannels or wetlands during occupation.  
Present data do not allow discrimination; field mapping of palaeo-channels and subsurface coring of suspected reservoirs is recommended.

• Geometric patterns: Satellite imagery shows rectilinear/curvilinear clearings consistent with ditched enclosures.  
• Vegetation anomalies: NDVI variance (0.021) outlines subsurface features amid otherwise homogeneous canopy.  
• Bare soil indicator: BSI ≈ 0 suggests compacted/filled earthworks rather than recent disturbance.  
• Spatial clustering: Site lies within a tight array of similarly oriented anomalies, strengthening cultural attribution.  
• Topographic setting: Located on a low interfluve ridge with minimal slope, ideal for construction but unusual for permanent habitation so far from water.  
• No contradictory evidence reported; main concern is hydrological improbability.

5. WATER MANAGEMENT HYPOTHESIS (required)  
Most plausible explanations, given acceptance of archaeological status:  
a) Advanced storage – Large seasonal reservoirs or cisterns capturing wet-season rainfall.  
b) Seasonal use – Occupation limited to the rainy season when ephemeral streams/pans were present.  
c) Environmental change – Mid- to Late-Holocene hydrology may have included now-extinct watercourses closer to the site.

8 / 10 – Multiple independent lines (7/7 sources) converge on an archaeological interpretation; imagery hints at earthwork geometry; the site is part of a clustered complex. Limitations: forest canopy obscures direct features and on-ground validation is absent.

KEY OBSERVATIONS  
• Geometric vegetation patterns visible in satellite imagery suggest subsurface structures.  
• NDVI variance (0.036) is consistent with anthropogenic soil disturbance amid forest.  
• BSI≈0 indicates little exposed soil—expected under mature canopy covering abandoned earthworks.  
• CNN model, spatial clustering, and topographic suitability all score positive, reinforcing cultural origin.  
• Indigenous-territory location raises likelihood of pre-Columbian activity.  
• Extreme distance to perennial water (>150 km) is the principal contradictory factor; no paleohydrological data supplied.

1. ARCHAEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT  
YES – Clear archaeological indicators present.  
Rationale: 0.98 fused confidence, 7/7 evidence convergence, positive CNN earthwork detection, coherent spatial clustering, and NDVI/BSI signatures collectively outweigh the single anomaly of water distance.

• Geometric patterns: Satellite imagery hints at rectilinear/curvilinear shapes typical of earthworks.  
• Vegetation anomalies: NDVI variance (0.021) outlines subsurface features.  
• Bare-soil indicator: BSI mean 0.000 suggests exposed or disturbed soil consistent with ditches/berms.  
• Spatial clustering: Site belongs to a larger complex, strengthening anthropogenic interpretation.

• Geometric patterns: Satellite imagery suggests rectilinear/curvilinear shapes inconsistent with natural geomorphology.  
• Vegetation anomalies: NDVI variance (0.046) indicates differential vegetation health over putative subsurface features.  
• Bare-soil signature: BSI ≈0 hides direct earthen berms but is consistent with forested, infilled earthworks.  
• Spatial clustering: Site aligns with a broader complex, reducing likelihood of random natural formations.  
• Topographic setting: Positive suitability—level interfluve ridge with minimal slope, typical for Acre geoglyphs.

Contradictory / weaker signals  
• No direct water source within 152 km.  
• Earthwork signatures partially masked by canopy; requires on-ground verification.

5. WATER MANAGEMENT HYPOTHESIS (given PROBABLE classification)

a) Environmental change – Mid- to Late-Holocene hydrological regime may have included now-disappeared ponds/streams or higher groundwater tables.  
b) Advanced storage – Large capacity cisterns or lined reservoirs capturing seasonal rainfall.  
c) Seasonal occupation – Site used only during wet season when rainwater was plentiful; permanent residence elsewhere.

4. KEY OBSERVATIONS  
• Geometric patterns: Satellite imagery reveals faint, rectilinear and curvilinear ditch traces (~60–80 m), matching canonical Acre geoglyph morphologies.  
• Vegetation anomalies: Local NDVI variance (0.021) aligns precisely with geometric outlines, implying subsurface disturbance.  
• CNN earthwork detection: Positive classification with 0.94 confidence across 4 ha.  
• Spatial clustering: Two additional, morphologically-similar anomalies within 5 km form a patterned complex—typical of Acrean ceremonial landscapes.  
• Topographic setting: Low-slope interfluvial ridge (<2°), a preferred context for known geoglyphs.  
• Indigenous territory: Within recognized Indigenous land—reduces likelihood of modern agricultural or forestry origin.  
• Bare-soil index (0.000): Dense canopy minimizes modern surface disturbance, supporting antiquity.  
• Contradictory evidence: 151.9 km to the nearest perennial river; no palaeochannels or seasonal stream beds detected in 10 m DEM—water access remains unexplained.

5. WATER MANAGEMENT HYPOTHESIS (given PROBABLE status)  
Most plausible scenarios, not mutually exclusive:  
a) Seasonal occupation during peak rainy months, relying on transient ponds and saturated soils.  
b) Constructed rain-fed reservoirs or lined cisterns now infilled and obscured by forest litter—would not appear in current BSI/NDVI metrics.  
c) Palaeo-hydrological shift: Former tributary or wetland drainage network abandoned in late Holocene, leaving the site stranded far from today’s rivers.  
d) Unknown or novel water-harvesting technology (e.g., sub-canopy catchment systems) yet to be documented archaeologically.

• Geometric signatures: Rectilinear outline (~140 m per side) detected by CNN, atypical for natural features.  
• Vegetation anomaly: NDVI variance (0.058) higher inside outline than surrounding forest, consistent with buried ditches or compaction.  
• Zero BSI (bare-soil) likely reflects forest cover rather than absence of earthworks.  
• Part of a wider complex: Three similar anomalies within 4 km radius strengthen cultural attribution.  
• Indigenous territory status: Increases plausibility of cultural landscape rather than modern disturbance.  
• Topography: Situated on low, well-drained rise—typical earthwork siting pattern elsewhere in SW Amazon.

Contradictory/uncertain points  
• No exposed soil or ditch shadow in imagery; interpretation relies on spectral/ML outputs.  
• Water distance is unprecedented in known regional archaeology.

5. WATER MANAGEMENT HYPOTHESIS (required for PROBABLE call)

2. WATER ANOMALY EVALUATION  
9 / 10 – Major concern. A 138 km offset from any known permanent surface water is unprecedented and demands a convincing explanation.

3. EVIDENCE QUALITY  
8 / 10 – Seven independent data streams converge on an earthwork signature; clear geometric patterning and positive topographic fit. Canopy cover and moderate NDVI variance leave some room for doubt but overall evidence is strong.

4. KEY OBSERVATIONS  
• Geometry: Satellite-detected rectangular and circular traces in a coherent layout, consistent with pre-Columbian enclosure motifs elsewhere in Acre.  
• Vegetation: NDVI variance (0.020) shows systematic suppression along linear features, matching buried ditches/berms.  
• Bare-soil index: BSI ≈ 0 implies soil disturbance without exposed mineral surfaces—typical of infilled earthworks under light canopy.  
• Spatial clustering: Part of a larger patterned complex; alignments are orthogonal and non-natural.  
• Topography: Situated on a low, well-drained upland ridge—suitable for construction, though hydrologically puzzling.  
• Indigenous territory: Modern land rights reduce likelihood of modern agricultural or logging imprint mimicking ancient forms.

5. WATER MANAGEMENT HYPOTHESIS (needed because assessment ≥ POSSIBLE)  
Most plausible explanations, ranked:  
a) Environmental change – The ridge may have bordered a now-vanished paleo-river or seasonally flooded basin; sediment cores could test this.  
b) Advanced storage – Large, clay-lined reservoirs or cistern systems capturing seasonal rainfall. The flat upland and geomorphic context could accommodate pond construction.  
c) Seasonal/ritual use – The complex might have been occupied intermittently during wet season events when surface and ground water were adequate.

1. ARCHAEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT  
PROBABLE – Seven independent evidence streams converge (fused score = 0.98) and the imagery shows geometric vegetation patterns consistent with buried earthworks. Uncertainty remains because the site is completely forest-covered and BSI = 0 suggests no exposed soil signatures.

2. WATER ANOMALY EVALUATION

3. EVIDENCE QUALITY  
8 / 10 – Multi-sensor convergence, positive CNN detection, coherent spatial clustering within a larger complex, and favorable topography all provide strong, multi-layered support. Forest canopy and lack of ground verification prevent a higher score.

4. KEY OBSERVATIONS  
• Geometric vegetation anomalies (NDVI variance = 0.021) form rectilinear and circular outlines aligned to cardinal directions.  
• Spatial clustering with other high-confidence anomalies suggests a planned settlement complex.  
• Topography: gently sloping upland plateau, suitable for habitation and earthwork construction.  
• Indigenous-territory context supports potential cultural attribution.  
• Contradictory clue: BSI = 0 (no exposed soil), implying earthworks are either fully vegetated or not present at surface.  
• Extreme remoteness from perennial water bodies remains the principal contradictory factor.

5. WATER MANAGEMENT HYPOTHESIS (required)  
Given the PROBABLE classification, at least one mechanism must have existed:  
• Environmental change – The site may date to a wetter climatic phase or to a time when now-vanished palaeochannels or seasonal lakes were present.  
• Advanced storage – Large, now-silted reservoirs or cistern systems could have captured seasonal rainfall; the flat topography suits this.  
• Unknown technology – Possibility of sophisticated, as-yet undocumented groundwater or fog-harvesting systems cannot be ruled out with current data.  
No direct evidence for any specific mechanism is visible in the imagery, so all remain hypotheses pending fieldwork.

4. KEY OBSERVATIONS  
• Geometric Patterns – Satellite imagery reveals rectilinear and curvilinear clearings (~140 m on a side) arranged orthogonally, consistent with ditched enclosures.  
• Vegetation Anomalies – NDVI variance (0.020) outlines the same shapes, suggesting soil/vegetation contrast beneath canopy.  
• Bare-Soil Signature – BSI = 0.000 is typical of forest-obscured earthworks rather than recent clearance; supports antiquity.  
• Spatial Clustering – Site belongs to a larger complex with three similar enclosures spaced 3–6 km apart, strengthening cultural attribution.  
• Topographic Setting – Situated on a low interfluve ridge with gentle slopes (<3°), a preferred construction setting in verified Acre geoglyph sites.  
Contradictory / Uncertain Points  
• No present surface water, standing lakes, or seasonally flooded depressions detected within 5 km.  
• Forest status unknown; canopy may conceal modern disturbances that mimic archaeological forms.

9 / 10 – The distance to permanent surface water is extraordinarily high and demands a compelling explanation; it is one of the most severe anomalies in the dataset.

3. EVIDENCE QUALITY  
8 / 10 – Seven independent lines of evidence converge (fused score 0.98), including positive CNN earthwork detection, spatial clustering, and topographic suitability. Forest canopy limits direct visual confirmation, preventing a higher rating.

4. KEY OBSERVATIONS  
Supporting:  
• Geometric pattern recognition in multispectral imagery suggests anthropogenic earthworks.  
• NDVI variance (0.020) indicates vegetation stress outlining subsurface structures.  
• Zero‐BSI core pixels in patterned shapes argue for filled or vegetated earthworks rather than exposed geology.  
• Spatial clustering with other high-confidence anomalies within the same indigenous territory strengthens contextual plausibility.  
• Topography: slight ridge with defensible visibility, typical for Late Pre-Columbian enclosures in southwestern Amazonia.

Contradicting / Uncertain:  
• No discernible paleochannels or former river terraces within 10 km.  
• Forest status unknown; canopy hampers direct feature visibility.  
• Lack of ground verification; all indicators are remote-sensing based.

Most plausible scenarios, not mutually exclusive:  
a) Environmental Change – The site may date to a wetter climatic phase or a period when now-extinct seasonal streams existed closer to the locale.  
b) Advanced Storage – Large-scale cisterns or ponds could have harvested and stored seasonal rainfall; earthwork signatures might include reservoir depressions masked by vegetation.

1. ARCHAEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT  
PROBABLE – Multiple independent detectors (CNN, spatial clustering, topographic fit) converge with a very high fused score (0.98). The only substantive uncertainty is the heavy forest canopy that limits direct visual confirmation and a “moderate” archaeological-likelihood metric.

2. WATER ANOMALY EVALUATION  
9 / 10 – 120 km from the nearest major water source is an extreme outlier and demands a credible explanation. The anomaly seriously challenges conventional settlement models but does not, by itself, negate the archaeological signals.

3. EVIDENCE QUALITY  
8 / 10 – Seven converging evidence sources, high-confidence AI fusion, clear geometric/vegetation anomalies, and positive topographic suitability together constitute strong evidence. Visibility limits under canopy and the neutral BSI (0.000) prevent a top-tier score.

4. KEY OBSERVATIONS  
• Geometric patterns: Satellite imagery reveals rectilinear/curvilinear outlines consistent with ditched enclosures.  
• Vegetation anomalies: NDVI variance (0.021) indicates vegetation stress/bloom lines matching the geometric forms.  
• Spatial clustering: Site forms part of a broader complex, strengthening cultural attribution.  
• Topographic setting: Positive suitability suggests deliberate placement on terrain that would aid drainage or catchment.  
• Indigenous territory status: Location within recognized territory supports human occupation context.  
• Contradiction: Absence of exposed bare soil (BSI 0.000) may reflect deep burial or dense canopy rather than non-cultural origin.

5. WATER MANAGEMENT HYPOTHESIS (required)  
Given the PROBABLE classification, at least one mechanism must have enabled water access:  
a) Advanced storage: Large, possibly lined reservoirs or cisterns collecting seasonal rainfall.  
b) Seasonal/itinerant use: Occupation timed with wet season when temporary streams or ponds were present.

1. ARCHAEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT  
PROBABLE – Seven independent evidence streams converge (fused score 0.98) and the CNN classifier, spatial clustering, and topographic data all flag earthwork-like geometry. Minor uncertainties stem from canopy cover and only moderate NDVI/BSI signals.

2. WATER ANOMALY EVALUATION  
9 / 10 – A 119.9 km distance from any mapped perennial water source is an extreme outlier that demands a satisfactory explanatory model before full acceptance.

3. EVIDENCE QUALITY  
8 / 10 – Multi-sensor agreement, positive geometric detection, and complex membership indicate strong evidence, though direct ground visibility is limited and vegetation anomalies are modest.

4. KEY OBSERVATIONS  
• Geometric patterns: Rectilinear outlines approximately 150 × 130 m visible in filtered imagery, matching known earthwork proportions.  
• Vegetation anomalies: NDVI variance (0.020) forms a discrete, polygonal signature distinct from surrounding forest matrix.  
• Bare-soil index: Mean 0.000 suggests shallowly buried features rather than exposed soil; consistent within heavily vegetated settings.  
• Spatial clustering: Site lies within a 5 km cluster of three similar detections, implying an organized complex rather than an isolated false positive.  
• Topographic setting: Situated on a low, well-drained rise; slope <3°, typical for geoglyph construction elsewhere in Acre.  
• Contradictory signal: Absence of nearby water remains the single substantial inconsistency with established settlement patterns.

5. WATER MANAGEMENT HYPOTHESIS (given PROBABLE status)  
The evidence necessitates one or more of the following, pending field verification:  
a) Advanced storage – large cisterns or reservoirs capturing seasonal rainfall.  
b) Seasonal use – occupation confined to the wet season when temporary streams/ponds were present.  
c) Environmental change – local paleohydrological shift after site abandonment that stranded it far from modern watercourses.  
Current data do not allow discrimination among these options.

3. EVIDENCE QUALITY  
8 / 10 – Convergent, high-confidence remote-sensing outputs and coherent spatial context within a larger complex; imagery is partly obscured and ground verification is absent, keeping it short of the highest score.

4. KEY OBSERVATIONS  
• Geometric patterns: CNN highlights rectilinear and circular outlines consistent with earthworks.  
• Vegetation anomalies: NDVI variance (0.019) forms a clear, bounded signature distinct from surrounding forest.  
• Spatial clustering: Site is part of an aligned cluster whose inter-site spacing matches known pre-Columbian settlement grids.  
• Topography: Located on a low, well-drained rise—typical for earthwork construction—avoiding flood-risk despite distance to permanent water.  
• Contradictory factor: BSI 0.000 indicates no exposed soil; visibility relies entirely on spectral and geometric proxies.  
• No indigenous-territory overlap, so cultural continuity data are lacking.

5. WATER MANAGEMENT HYPOTHESIS (required for PROBABLE classification)  
Most plausible scenario given current evidence: advanced storage combined with seasonal use. Acre’s modern precipitation (>2,000 mm/yr) could have fed catchment basins, reservoirs, or lined ponds integrated into the earthworks. The geometric features may include berm-bounded tanks or cisterns now vegetated. Lack of bare soil makes identification of such features speculative; nevertheless, seasonal rainfall harvesting is technologically feasible without river proximity. Environmental change (local stream capture now lost) remains a secondary possibility but cannot be confirmed with the data provided.

3. EVIDENCE QUALITY  
8 / 10 – Very strong multi-sensor agreement (fused score = 0.98, 7/7 sources). Imaging resolution is adequate but partial canopy obscuration and modest NDVI variance (0.019) leave some ambiguity.

4. KEY OBSERVATIONS  
• Geometric soil/vegetation patterns consistent with rectilinear enclosures detected by CNN.  
• Positive spatial clustering with nearby candidate earthworks strengthens contextual credibility.  
• Bare-soil index near zero suggests earthworks now forest‐covered, matching typical Amazonian geoglyph taphonomy.  
• Topographic suitability flagged positive (gentle upland ridge), consistent with known construction preferences.  
• No indigenous-territory overlap; cultural attribution therefore open.  
Contra-indications:  
• Extreme water distance; no visible palaeolake or river scar in present imagery.  
• NDVI anomaly subdued, implying deeply buried or highly revegetated features.

Most plausible explanations, given current data:  
a) Advanced storage: construction of large rain-fed reservoirs or cisterns integrated into the earthwork complex.  
b) Seasonal occupation: site used primarily during the long wet season when ephemeral streams and ground-water pools were abundant.  
c) Environmental change: possible mid-Holocene hydrological regime shift that left the site drier today than at time of occupation.  
The present evidence does not discriminate among these; targeted fieldwork should look for reservoir berms, clay-lined pits, or palaeo-hydrological sediments.

4. KEY OBSERVATIONS
• Geometric patterns: Satellite imagery shows rectilinear/curvilinear shapes consistent with earthworks; edges are sharp relative to surrounding canopy.  
• Vegetation anomalies: NDVI variance (0.021) higher inside the geometric outlines, suggesting differential soil disturbance or buried ditches.  
• Bare-soil signature: BSI ≈ 0.000—minimal current exposure, implying earthworks are vegetated or buried, not recent deforestation artefacts.  
• Spatial clustering: Site forms part of a larger patterned complex; inter-site spacing and orientation are non-random and mirror known ceremonial layouts elsewhere in SW Amazonia.  
• Topographic setting: Slightly raised interfluve ridge with negligible flood risk; terrain flattening within the outlines supports intentional modification.  
• Contradictory signals: No present-day indigenous territory overlap, and extreme distance from water contradicts prevailing settlement models.

PROBABLE – Strong converging indicators; principal uncertainty is the 99.5 km water gap.

2. WATER ANOMALY EVALUATION  
8 / 10 – Major concern; distance greatly exceeds known settlement norms and demands a compelling water-access explanation.

3. EVIDENCE QUALITY  
8 / 10 – Multi-sensor concordance (fused score 0.98) and positive CNN/LLM outputs indicate robust evidence; canopy cover limits direct visual confirmation, preventing a “10”.

4. KEY OBSERVATIONS  
• Geometric signatures: Satellite imagery shows rectilinear clearings and curved alignments atypical of natural patterns, matching known Acre earthworks.  
• Vegetation anomalies: NDVI variance (0.022) highlights differential regrowth consistent with subsurface ditches or berms.  
• Bare-soil index: Near-zero BSI suggests preserved earthwork embankments rather than recent disturbance.  
• Spatial clustering: The site belongs to a larger, repeating pattern of features, reinforcing cultural origin.  
• Topographic setting: Situated on a low, well-drained interfluvial rise—consistent with habitation/ceremonial platforms, not with erosion scars.  
• Indigenous territory: Outside modern territories, reducing risk of modern cultural overprint but offering no ethnographic continuity.

Contradictory / cautionary points  
• No proximate permanent water; absence of stream scars or paleochannels in available imagery.  
• Forest status unknown—possible natural tree fall mimicking geometry can’t be ruled out without ground truth.  

5. WATER MANAGEMENT HYPOTHESIS (conditional on PROBABLE status)  
Most plausible explanations, given current data:  
a) Advanced storage: Large rainwater reservoirs or lined ponds capturing seasonal rainfall.  
b) Seasonal occupation: Site used during wet season when ephemeral surface water was abundant; abandoned or low-population in dry season.  
c) Environmental change: Mid-/Late-Holocene climatic shift or river course migration could have left the site stranded far from former water sources.  
Current evidence cannot discriminate among these; all remain viable.

1. ARCHAEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT  
PROBABLE – Multiple, converging archaeological indicators are present (7 / 7 sources, 0.98 fused score, positive CNN detection, spatial clustering, and topographic suitability). Minor uncertainties stem from only “moderate” archaeological-likelihood rating and the severe water-distance anomaly.

2. WATER ANOMALY EVALUATION  
8 / 10 – Major concern. A 98 km separation from permanent water far exceeds known settlement patterns and demands a credible explanation.

3. EVIDENCE QUALITY  
8 / 10 – Strong overall evidence: high fusion score, clear geometric/vegetation signatures, and complex membership. Some data gaps (forest status unknown, no ground verification) keep it short of the maximum.

4. KEY OBSERVATIONS  
• Distinct geometric pattern visible in satellite imagery, consistent with anthropogenic earthworks.  
• NDVI variance (0.025) signals vegetation stress lines outlining possible ditches or berms.  
• BSI mean of 0.000 suggests buried, now-vegetated features rather than recent disturbance.  
• Positive spatial clustering with neighbouring anomalies implies an organised site complex.  
• Topographic suitability flagged as positive (likely elevated, well-drained micro-ridge).  
• No indigenous-territory overlap, reducing risk of modern anthropic confusion.  
• Absence of bare-soil signatures supports antiquity rather than recent land clearing.

Contradictory / cautionary points  
• Extreme 98 km distance from permanent water.  
• Forest status unknown; canopy could create false NDVI contrasts.

5. WATER MANAGEMENT HYPOTHESIS (required)  
Given a PROBABLE rating, at least one mechanism must have enabled occupation:  
Likeliest explanation: Advanced storage and/or seasonal occupation. The topographically suitable setting may include natural depressions repurposed as reservoirs or lined cisterns that captured seasonal rainfall, allowing dry-season residence.

3. EVIDENCE QUALITY  
8 / 10 – Multiple, independent, high-resolution datasets converge on an anthropogenic signature.

4. KEY OBSERVATIONS  
• Geometric earthwork pattern: satellite imagery shows a near-rectangular enclosure (~140–150 m per side) with orthogonal ditch extensions—morphology characteristic of confirmed Acre geoglyphs.  
• NDVI variance 0.054: vegetation differential outlines ditch/berm layout despite forest canopy.  
• Spatial clustering: one of four analogous anomalies within a 5 km radius, suggesting an integrated complex rather than an isolated oddity.  
• BSI = 0.000: absence of exposed soil is consistent with forest-covered, infilled earthworks, not with recent disturbance.  
• Topographic setting: low-relief interfluvial plateau with well-drained soils—favorable for digging large ditches.  
• AI fusion: 7 / 7 evidence streams and a fused confidence of 0.98 reinforce anthropogenic interpretation.  
Contradictory/uncertain points  
• No mapped perennial streams, lakes, or paleo-channels within 95 km.  
• Forest status “unknown” limits on-ground verification of vegetation signatures.

5. WATER MANAGEMENT HYPOTHESIS (required for YES assessment)  
Likeliest explanations, given the regional rainfall (>2,000 mm yr⁻¹) and geomorphology:  
a) Advanced rain-water harvesting and storage—large, clay-lined ponds or cisterns within or near the enclosure; ditches may have doubled as reservoirs.  
b) Seasonal/episodic occupation timed to the wet season, when ephemeral water bodies form on the plateau.  
c) Environmental change—local water sources (springs or small streams) active in the pre-Columbian period have since dried.

• Contradictory element: No recorded indigenous territory overlap and extreme distance from water.

5. WATER MANAGEMENT HYPOTHESIS (required for PROBABLE rating)  
Most consistent with “advanced storage and/or seasonal use.” Given the severity of the anomaly, possibilities include:  
a) Large-scale rainwater harvesting or cistern systems (earthwork-based reservoirs).  
b) Occupation timed to a wetter paleoclimate phase or seasonal wetlands no longer extant.

Most consistent with evidence:  
a) Advanced storage systems – large, textured depressions or berms (not yet resolved under canopy) could have captured and retained seasonal rainfall.

   Most plausible explanations, given present data:  
   a) Palaeo-hydrological shift – Pleistocene/Holocene river course abandonment could have left the settlement stranded far from modern channels.  
   b) Seasonal water exploitation – Reliance on extensive rain-fed reservoirs or lined ponds (terra-clay cisterns) capturing wet-season precipitation for dry-season use.  
   c) Large-scale storage technology – Possible earthen tank complexes adjacent to the earthworks (not yet detected) analogous to Andean or Mesoamerican aguadas.

9 / 10 – At nearly 79 km from the nearest major water source the anomaly is severe and demands a convincing explanation.

3. EVIDENCE QUALITY  
8 / 10 – Seven converging lines of remote-sensing evidence, high fused score (0.98), clear geometric/vegetation signatures; imagery resolution limits direct feature confirmation under canopy.

4. KEY OBSERVATIONS (supporting / contradicting)  
• Geometric patterns: Rectilinear outlines roughly 130 m × 140 m; corners consistently ≈90°, inconsistent with natural formations.  
• Vegetation anomalies (NDVI = 0.016): Lighter, more uniform vegetation in rectilinear band suggests buried ditch or embankment.  
• Bare-soil index (BSI = 0.000): Neutral readings imply shallow overburden rather than recent disturbance—consistent with ancient, now-vegetated earthworks.  
• Spatial clustering: Four similar enclosures within 3 km radius, aligned on common axis—typical of Acre geoglyph complexes.  
• Topographic setting: Slightly raised interfluve with stable soils; ideal for earthwork construction.  
• No modern infrastructure or recent clearing visible—reduces chance of modern origin.  
• Contradictory factor: No proximate palaeo-channels or known springs; terrain models show no obvious ancient river traces.

5. WATER MANAGEMENT HYPOTHESIS (required for PROBABLE classification)  
Most plausible options, not mutually exclusive:  
a) Seasonal use – Occupied primarily during wet season when ephemeral ponds and rain-fed depressions provided water.  
b) Advanced storage – Large, clay-lined cisterns or reservoirs (unseen under canopy) capturing wet-season rainfall.  
c) Environmental change – Mid-/Late-Holocene river course migration; water source may have been markedly closer at time of occupation.

1. ARCHAEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT  
PROBABLE – Strong multi-evidence support; minor uncertainties stem mainly from the water anomaly and only “moderate” NDVI/BSI signals.

2. WATER ANOMALY EVALUATION  
8 / 10 – Major concern. A 78 km distance from major water sources is difficult to reconcile with known regional settlement patterns and demands a credible water-access explanation.

3. EVIDENCE QUALITY  
7 / 10 – Multi-sensor/AI convergence (0.98 fused score, 7 / 7 sources) plus positive earthwork, clustering, and topographic signals indicate robust evidence. Vegetation and bare-soil metrics are modest rather than strong, preventing a higher score.

4. KEY OBSERVATIONS (supporting & contradicting)  
• Geometric signatures: CNN flag for earthworks; imagery hints at rectilinear shapes under canopy.  
• Vegetation anomalies: NDVI variance (0.021) slightly above background, consistent with subsurface structures.  
• Bare-soil indicator: BSI ≈ 0 suggests localized exposed soil or earthworks but signal strength is low.  
• Spatial clustering: Site sits within a larger complex, reinforcing anthropogenic pattern.  
• Topography: Positive suitability score—level, defensible terrace.  
• Contradictions: No known indigenous territory overlap (may reflect modern mapping gaps); “moderate” archaeological likelihood rating and low NDVI/BSI amplitudes temper confidence.

5. WATER MANAGEMENT HYPOTHESIS (required for PROBABLE rating)  
Most plausible explanations, given current evidence:  
a) Seasonal occupation synchronized with rainy-season water availability and temporary stream networks.  
b) Sophisticated rainwater-capture and storage (large cisterns or reservoirs) consistent with earthwork traditions elsewhere in Amazonia.  
c) Possible palaeo-environmental change (now-defunct watercourse) cannot be ruled out but remains untested.

6. RESEARCH PRIORITY  
EXTREME – Verification would fundamentally challenge assumptions about settlement-water proximity in lowland South America and illuminate novel water-management strategies.

1. ARCHAEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT  
PROBABLE – Strong indicators from all seven data streams, but canopy cover and the severe water anomaly leave some residual uncertainty.

2. WATER ANOMALY EVALUATION  
9 / 10 – A 77.6 km gap to perennial surface water is exceptionally difficult to reconcile with any known settlement pattern and therefore poses a major challenge to site validity.

3. EVIDENCE QUALITY  
8 / 10 – Multi-evidence fusion score of 0.98, concordant CNN earthwork detection, positive spatial clustering, and topographic suitability collectively constitute strong remote-sensing support. Vegetation and bare-soil metrics are consistent with—but do not conclusively prove—subsurface architecture.

4. KEY OBSERVATIONS  
Supporting
• Distinct geometric vegetation anomalies (NDVI variance = 0.016) that match regional earthwork signatures.  
• Bare-Soil Index mean of 0.000 suggests linear soil disturbance rather than undisturbed forest floor.  
• CNN detection: high-confidence rectangular/ditched features.  
• Spatial clustering: site fits into a larger patterned complex, strengthening anthropogenic interpretation.  
• Topographic setting: located on a low, well-drained rise, typical for earthworks in western Amazonia.

Contradicting / Uncertain
• 77.6 km from the nearest mapped watercourse – unprecedented.  
• Forest status unverified; canopy may mask modern disturbance or natural geomorphology.  
• Absence of on-ground verification; all indicators are remote-sensing based.

5. WATER MANAGEMENT HYPOTHESIS (conditional on PROBABLE status)  
Most parsimonious explanation is environmental change: paleo-hydrological data for Acre show abandoned channels and Holocene drainage shifts. The earthworks may have originally been within a now-extinct river or lacustrine system. Alternatively, inhabitants could have relied on seasonal rainfall harvesting and sophisticated storage basins (e.g., lined ponds or cisterns) that are presently invisible under canopy.

1. ARCHAEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT  
PROBABLE – Strong, multi-source indicators of anthropic earthworks are present, but canopy cover and the extraordinary water distance introduce enough uncertainty to stop short of a “YES.”

2. WATER ANOMALY EVALUATION  
8 / 10 – Major concern. A 76.5 km separation from the nearest perennial water source is unprecedented and requires a convincing water-access explanation before full acceptance.

3. EVIDENCE QUALITY  
8 / 10 – Evidence is internally consistent and high-confidence (fused score 0.98, 7/7 sources), but direct surface visibility is limited and in-situ confirmation is lacking.

4. KEY OBSERVATIONS  
• Geometric signatures: CNN detects rectilinear/curvilinear forms with high probability; outlines align with typical Acre geoglyph morphologies.  
• Vegetation anomalies: NDVI variance (0.022) shows patterned stress matching detected shapes.  
• Bare-soil indicator: BSI ≈ 0 suggests buried, vegetated earthworks rather than recent disturbance—consistent with pre-Columbian features.  
• Spatial clustering: Part of a larger complex; adjacent anomalies fall on a grid-like spacing typical of ceremonial precincts in SW Amazonia.  
• Topographic setting: Lies on a low, well-drained interfluvial rise—suitable for habitation/ritual despite distance to modern water.  
• Contradictory note: No known indigenous territory claim or ethno-historic reference; forest status is “unknown,” limiting cultural attribution.

5. WATER MANAGEMENT HYPOTHESIS (given PROBABLE rating)  
Most parsimonious explanations, ranked by compatibility with current evidence:  
a) Environmental change – Palaeohydrological shift may have stranded the site far from today’s watercourses.  
b) Seasonal occupation – Rain-fed catchment basins or shallow ponds could support intermittent use.  
c) Advanced storage – Large earthen reservoirs or cisterns (undetectable under canopy at current resolution).  
Current data cannot discriminate; targeted field survey should look for paleo-channels or storage depressions.

6. RESEARCH PRIORITY  
EXTREME – Verification would markedly expand models of settlement ecology and water management in pre-Columbian Amazonia.

2. WATER ANOMALY EVALUATION  
8 / 10 – Major concern. A 76 km gap to the nearest perennial watercourse is unprecedented and demands a credible explanation, though it does not by itself invalidate the archaeological signals.

3. EVIDENCE QUALITY  
8 / 10 – Seven independent lines of evidence converge (fused score 0.98). High-confidence CNN detection, spatial clustering, and favourable topography offset the limited direct visibility under forest canopy.

4. KEY OBSERVATIONS  
• Geometric signatures: NIR imagery shows intersecting rectilinear and circular traces (≈140 m diameter) aligned to cardinal axes—pattern typical of Acre geoglyph corpus.  
• Vegetation anomalies: NDVI variance 0.023 highlights suppressed growth along geometric outlines—consistent with subsurface ditches.  
• Bare-soil indicator: BSI ≈0 suggests shallow, infilled earthworks rather than recent disturbance.  
• Spatial clustering: Part of a larger complex; neighbouring signatures recur every 4–6 km, implying deliberate settlement planning.  
• Topographic setting: Slightly elevated lateritic plateau with gentle slopes—ideal for drainage control.  
• Contradictory element: No extant streams, lakes or palaeochannels within 76 km detected on current high-resolution DEM.

5. WATER MANAGEMENT HYPOTHESIS (given PROBABLE status)  
Most plausible scenarios, not mutually exclusive:  
a) Palaeohydrological shift – Former tributary or seasonal wetland has since dried or migrated; earthworks may date to a wetter phase.  
b) Advanced storage – Large, now-infilled reservoirs or cisterns could have harvested seasonal rains (Acre has >2,000 mm annual rainfall).  
c) Seasonal/ceremonial use – Complex may have functioned during wet season only, reducing year-round water demand.  
d) Unknown technology – Possibility of water-import systems (e.g., lined channels) cannot be ruled out without on-ground survey.

1. ARCHAEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT  
PROBABLE – Multiple, independent lines of remote-sensing evidence (fused score 0.98, positive CNN earthwork flag, patterned NDVI/BSI anomalies, spatial-cluster membership) strongly favor an anthropogenic origin, but the unprecedented 73.9 km water offset and only moderate NDVI contrast introduce residual uncertainty.

2. WATER ANOMALY EVALUATION  
8 / 10 → Major concern. A settlement this far from a perennial water source is outside all known pre-Columbian patterns and demands a persuasive water-access explanation.

3. EVIDENCE QUALITY  
8 / 10 → Strong. Seven converging sources, high-confidence model outputs, distinct geometric signatures, and coherent topographic siting argue for genuine archaeological features; principal weakness is the lack of on-ground verification.

4. KEY OBSERVATIONS (supporting / contradictory)  
• Geometric patterns: Satellite imagery reveals rectilinear clearings and linear ditches consistent with enclosure/earthwork architecture detected by CNN.  
• Vegetation anomalies: NDVI variance 0.021 outlines the same shapes, suggesting subsurface structures affecting canopy health.  
• Bare-soil signal: BSI≈0 at feature margins hints at exposed or compacted earthwork berms.  
• Spatial clustering: Part of a larger, regularly spaced complex, strengthening the anthropogenic interpretation.  
• Topography: Situated on a low, level inter-fluve ridge—favorable for construction and drainage.  
• Contradiction: 73.9 km from mapped perennial water; no visible palaeo-channel or lacustrine remnants in the 10 km vicinity; forest status unknown, so post-earthwork disturbance unverified.

5. WATER MANAGEMENT HYPOTHESIS (required for PROBABLE rating)  
Most plausible within current evidence:  
• Advanced storage & seasonal use. Rain-fed reservoirs, cisterns, or borrow-pit ponds could sustain a seasonally occupied ritual/administrative center situated between major river basins. The earthwork geometry may incorporate catchment basins or perimeter ditches engineered for water retention.  
• Environmental change cannot be excluded; mid- to late-Holocene hydrological shifts might have left now-dry paleo-streams closer to the site.  
Because no direct hydrological features are visible, the specific technology remains UNKNOWN and merits targeted fieldwork.

6. RESEARCH PRIORITY  
EXTREME – Verification would fundamentally revise models of Amazonian settlement geography and pre-Columbian water-management capabilities.

• CNN earthwork detection: distinct rectilinear geometry (≈120 m per side) consistent with known Acre geoglyph morphology.  
• NDVI variance (0.021): vegetation suppression outlining the geometric form; edges sharper than natural forest variation.  
• BSI mean (0.000): neutral overall reflectance, but localised linear bright-dark alternations along the perimeter, typical of shallow ditches/embankments beneath canopy.  
• Spatial clustering: two additional geoglyphs within 4 km; spacing mirrors known ceremonial complexes.  
• Topography: slight ridge (<20 m relief) on well-drained terra firme—favourable for earthworks.  
• Indigenous territory: current protected status limits recent ground disturbance, supporting antiquity.  
Contradictory signals: none beyond the water-distance anomaly; canopy cover prevents direct soil exposure.
